# 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

This repository contains concepts and examples related to Python's more advanced data structures, specifically sets and dictionaries.

## Introduction

Python provides additional data structures beyond lists and tuples. Two commonly used ones are sets and dictionaries. This README provides an overview of sets, dictionaries, and common operations performed on them.

## Sets

- Sets are unordered collections that store unique elements.
- They are created by enclosing elements in curly braces `{ }` or using the `set()` function.
- Sets are useful for performing mathematical set operations like union, intersection, and difference.
- Elements in a set cannot be accessed by index since they are unordered.
- Common set operations include adding or removing elements, checking membership, and performing set operations.

## Dictionaries

- Dictionaries are unordered collections that store key-value pairs.
- They are created by enclosing key-value pairs in curly braces `{ }` or using the `dict()` constructor.
- Keys in a dictionary are unique, and values can be of any data type.
- Dictionaries provide a way to access values directly using their associated keys.
- Common dictionary operations include adding or removing key-value pairs, accessing values, and iterating over keys or values.

## Common Operations

Both sets and dictionaries support various operations:

- Adding elements: Elements can be added to a set using the `add()` method or to a dictionary by assigning a value to a new key.
- Removing elements: Elements can be removed from a set using the `discard()` or `remove()` methods, and from a dictionary using the `del` statement.
- Checking membership: Set membership can be checked using the `in` keyword, and dictionary membership can be checked using the `in` keyword on the dictionary keys.
- Accessing values: Values can be accessed from a dictionary directly using their associated keys.
- Updating values: Values associated with existing keys in a dictionary can be updated by reassigning them.
- Length: The number of elements in a set or dictionary can be obtained using the `len()` function.
- Iterating: Elements in both sets and dictionaries can be accessed using loops.

## Conclusion

Understanding sets and dictionaries in Python is essential for working with more complex and structured data. This README provided an introduction to sets, dictionaries, and common operations performed on them.
