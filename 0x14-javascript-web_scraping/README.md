# 0x14 JavaScript Web Scraping

## Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive guide and code examples for web scraping using JavaScript. Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites, which can be useful for various purposes such as data analysis, research, and automation. JavaScript is a powerful tool for web scraping due to its ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and interact with web pages dynamically.
