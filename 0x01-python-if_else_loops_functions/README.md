# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

This repository contains projects and exercises focused on if/else statements, loops, and functions in Python. The projects are designed to help you practice and solidify your understanding of these fundamental concepts in Python programming.

## Project Overview

The projects in this repository cover a range of topics related to if/else statements, loops, and functions in Python. You will learn how to effectively use conditional statements, loops, and functions to control the flow of your programs, make decisions, and execute repeated tasks.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into different directories, each representing a specific project or exercise. Here's an overview of the project structure:

- **0-positive_or_negative**: This project focuses on writing an if/else statement to determine whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero.

- **1-last_digit**: In this project, you will learn how to extract the last digit of a given number and perform various operations based on its value using if/else statements.

- **2-print_alphabet**: The goal of this project is to print the alphabet in lowercase using loops and the ASCII values for the characters.

- **3-print_alphabt**: This project extends the previous one by excluding specific letters from the alphabet while printing using if/else statements.

- **4-print_hexa**: Here, you will utilize loops to print the decimal numbers and their hexadecimal representations in a specific format.

- **5-print_comb2**: This project challenges you to print all possible combinations of two-digit numbers using loops and if/else statements.

- **6-print_comb3**: In this exercise, you will modify the previous project to print all possible combinations of three-digit numbers.

## Acknowledgments

These projects are part of the ALX Software Engineering program. I would like to extend our gratitude to the ALX community members and instructors for their contributions in developing these projects and providing valuable guidance throughout the learning process.

I hope you find these projects engaging and helpful in your journey to master if/else statements, loops, and functions in Python. Enjoy the process of expanding your coding skills and unlocking new possibilities with Python programming!
